        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "- Interpreted languages run code line-by-line using an interpreter. They are   generally slower, errors appear during execution, and examples include Python, JavaScript.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Compiled languages convert the entire program into machine code before execution. They run faster, errors are caught before running, and examples include C, C++\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that occur while a program is running, so the program doesn't crash.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The finally block is used to run code always, whether an exception occurs or not.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method in Python is a destructor that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",

        "\n",
        "9.  What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "- Multithreading uses multiple threads within the same process, sharing the same memory.\n",

        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Memory management in Python refers to how Python allocates, uses, and frees memory for objects during program execution.\n",
        "It includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Automatic memory allocation for variables and objects\n",
        "\n",
        "- Garbage collection, which removes unused objects\n",

        "\n",
        "- A memory manager that handles memory requests internally\n",
        "\n",
        "- In simple terms, Python manages memory automatically so the programmer doesn’t have to do it manually.\n",
        "\n",

        "- The except block catches the error and handles it, preventing the program from crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "- It mainly uses reference counting: each object keeps track of how many references point to it. When the count reaches zero, the object is deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It also uses a cyclic garbage collector to detect and clean up reference cycles (objects referencing each other).\n",
        "\n",
        "- This ensures efficient memory usage and prevents memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The else block is used to run code only if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
